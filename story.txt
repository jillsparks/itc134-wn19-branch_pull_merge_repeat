This is a screwball comedy with a focus on remorse. The story is about a coachman, a cheerful coach, and a just daycare employee. It starts in a village. The story ends with a slip of the tongue.
David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum, for acting strangely at the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman, where they had cornered the circus leopard. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the "Leopard Gang"; she calls herself "Swingin' Door Susie" and David "Jerry the Nipper".
