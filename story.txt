This is a screwball comedy with a focus on remorse. The story is about a coachman, a cheerful coach, and a just daycare employee. The story starts in a village, and it ends with a slip of the tongue.

group-story

David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum, for acting strangely at the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman, where they had cornered the circus leopard. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the "Leopard Gang"; she calls herself "Swingin' Door Susie" and David "Jerry the Nipper". Eventually, Alexander Peabody shows up to verify everyone's identity. Susan, who escaped out a window during a police interview, unwittingly drags the highly irritated circus leopard into the jail. David saves her, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.

Myra's story
The story is about an irrational politician who is stalked by a tactful video game programmer. It takes place in a jail in Cairo. The story climaxes with someone buying a dwelling. A magical artifact plays an important role.

How is everyone doing today? I hope you guys are doing great. 
I'm well. You?

Hi!  I think this is working....What do you guys think?  Does this mean we are branching and merging correctly?

Adding to story yet again

David and Susan escape jail and head out to find some weed to calm their nerves. They know a guy in town who sells the best stuff and head over to his flat to get some. They get the weed and head over to a park and smoke some and this weed is no ordinary weed, it takes them into an alternative universe where they are being chased by Aliens. They have to run from the Aliens throughout their trip until the weed wears off and they end up back on the grass safe and sound in the park.

Hi Nicole!  I think this is working. I added Mr. Newman as a collaborator and we each need to upload a link to turn in assignment.
